# Installation

 * Install [lunarvim](https://www.lunarvim.org/01-installing.html#prerequisites)
 * Ensure your terminal font support for non-ascii icons [TBD]. [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) supports this by default
 * Override ~/.config/local/lvim/config.lua with the current file and copy the `after` directory in the same location [install script TBD]
