# Installation

 * Install [lunarvim](https://www.lunarvim.org/01-installing.html#prerequisites)
 * Ensure your terminal has font support for non-ascii icons [TBD]. [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) supports this by default
 * Copy config to ~/.config/local/lvim/config.lua [install script TBD]


# Color Configuration

 * The colorscheme and icons in this config assume that your terminal is configured appropriately. 
 For sample default colors (e.g., for Wezterm) see [here](https://github.com/nettrino/dotfiles/blob/master/wezterm.lua)
